## Overview
This repository provides a **Sleep Disorder Detection & Prediction** project with multiple interfaces:
- A Flask-based API  
- A Flask-based web application  
- A Streamlit application  
- A Gradio interface  

You can use any of these interfaces to predict sleep disorders based on user input from a dataset of sleep, health, and lifestyle attributes.

## Problem Statement
Sleep disorders affect millions of people worldwide, often leading to reduced quality of life and serious health issues. Accurate and timely detection of sleep disorders can help individuals seek appropriate treatment and improve their well-being. This project aims to:

1. Analyze relevant health and lifestyle data (e.g., age, BMI, daily activities).  
2. Predict the likelihood of common sleep disorders.  
3. Provide a user-friendly interface for clinicians and individuals to assess their sleep health.
